.SH "NAME"
ipnrc \- IPN scheme configuration commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1IPN\s0 scheme configuration commands are passed to \fBipnadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBipnadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.
.PP
\&\s-1IPN\s0 scheme configuration commands (a) establish egress plans for direct
transmission to neighboring nodes that are members of endpoints identified
in the \*(L"ipn\*(R" \s-1URI\s0 scheme and (b) establish static default routing rules
for forwarding bundles to specified destination nodes.
.PP
The egress \fBplan\fR established for a given node associates a default egress
\&\fBduct expression\fR with that node, and that default duct expression may be
overridden by more narrowly scoped \fBplanrule\fRs in specific circumstances:
a different egress duct expression may apply when the source endpoint for
the subject bundle identifies a specific node, a specific service, or both.
.PP
Each duct expression is a string of the form
"\fIprotocol_name\fR/\fIoutduct_name\fR[,\fIdestination_induct_name\fR]",
signifying that the bundle is to be queued for transmission via the
indicated convergence layer protocol outduct.  \fIdestination_induct_name\fR
must be provided when the indicated outduct is \*(L"promiscuous\*(R", i.e., not
configured for transmission only to a single neighboring node; this is
protocol-specific.
.PP
The circumstances that characterize a specific rule within a general plan
are expressed in a \fBqualifier\fR, a string of the form
"\fIsource_service_number\fR \fIsource_node_number\fR" where either
\&\fIsource_service_number\fR or \fIsource_node_number\fR may be an asterisk
character (*) signifying \*(L"all\*(R".
.PP
Note that egress plans \fBmust\fR be established for all neighboring nodes,
regardless of whether or not contact graph routing is used for computing
dynamic routes to distant nodes.  This is by definition: if there isn't
an egress plan to a node, it can't be considered a neighbor.
.PP
Static default routes are declared as \fBexits\fR in the ipn-scheme routing
database.  An exit is a range of node numbers identifying a set of nodes
for which defined default routing behavior is established.  Whenever a
bundle is to be forwarded to a node whose number is in the exit's node
number range \fBand\fR it has not been possible to compute a dynamic route
to that node from the contact schedules that have been provided to the
local node \fBand\fR that node is not a neighbor to which the bundle can
be directly transmitted, \s-1BP\s0 will forward the bundle to the \fBgateway\fR node
associated with this exit.  The gateway node for any exit is identified
by an endpoint \s-1ID,\s0 which might or might not be an ipn-scheme \s-1EID\s0; regardless,
directing a bundle to the gateway for an exit causes the bundle to be
re-forwarded to that intermediate destination endpoint.  Multiple exits
may encompass the same node number, in which case the gateway associated
with the most restrictive exit (the one with the smallest range) is
always selected.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR that \*(L"exits\*(R" were termed \*(L"groups\*(R" in earlier versions of \s-1ION. \s0 The
term \*(L"exit\*(R" has been adopted instead, to minimize any possible confusion
with multicast groups.  To protect backward compatibility, the keywords
\&\*(L"group\*(R" and \*(L"grouprule\*(R" continue to be accepted by ipnadmin as aliases
for the new keywords \*(L"exit\*(R" and \*(L"exitrule\*(R", but the older terminology is
deprecated.
.PP
The formats and effects of the \s-1IPN\s0 scheme configuration commands are
described below.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ipnadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"

combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.

.IP "a plan 18 ltp/18" 4
.IX Item "a plan 18 ltp/18"
Declares the egress plan to use for transmission from the local node to
neighboring node 18.  By default, any bundle for which the computed \*(L"next
hop\*(R" node is node 18 will be queued for transmission on \s-1LTP\s0 outduct 18.

.IX Item "a planrule 18 * 9 tcp/119.31.01.18:4016"
Declares an egress plan override that applies to transmission to node 18
of any bundle whose source is node 9, regardless of the service that was
the source of the bundle.  Each such bundle must be queued for transmission
on \s-1TCP\s0 outduct 119.31.01.18:4016 rather than the default (transmission
on \s-1LTP\s0 outduct 18).
