.SH "NAME"
bprc \- Bundle Protocol management commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Bundle Protocol management commands are passed to \fBbpadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBbpadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The formats
and effects of the Bundle Protocol management commands are described below.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by bpadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed and the
crypto suite \s-1BP\s0 was compiled with.  \s-1HINT:\s0 combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log
the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, Bundle Protocol
is not in operation on the local \s-1ION\s0 node and most \fIbpadmin\fR commands will
fail.
.IP "\fBr\fR '\fIcommand_text\fR'" 4
.IX Item "r 'command_text'"
The \fBrun\fR command.  This command will execute \fIcommand_text\fR as if it
had been typed at a console prompt.  It is used to, for example, run
another administrative program.
.IP "\fBs\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
The \fBstart\fR command.  This command starts all schemes and all protocols
on the local node.
.IP "\fBm heapmax\fR \fImax_database_heap_per_acquisition\fR" 4
.IX Item "m heapmax max_database_heap_per_acquisition"
The \fBmanage heap for bundle acquisition\fR command.  This command declares
the maximum number of bytes of \s-1SDR\s0 heap space that will be occupied by any
single bundle acquisition activity (nominally the acquisition of a single
bundle, but this is at the discretion of the convergence-layer input task).
All data acquired in excess of this limit will be written to a temporary file
pending extraction and dispatching of the acquired bundle or bundles.  Default
is the minimum allowed value (560 bytes), which is the approximate size of a
\&\s-1ZCO\s0 file reference object; this is the minimum \s-1SDR\s0 heap space occupancy in the
event that all acquisition is into a file.
.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
The \fBstop\fR command.  This command stops all schemes and all protocols
on the local node.
.IP "\fBw\fR { 0 | 1 | \fIactivity_spec\fR }" 4
.IX Item "w { 0 | 1 | activity_spec }"
The \fB\s-1BP\s0 watch\fR command.  This command enables and disables production of
a continuous stream of user-selected Bundle Protocol activity indication
characters.  A watch parameter of \*(L"1\*(R" selects
all \s-1BP\s0 activity indication characters; \*(L"0\*(R" de-selects all \s-1BP\s0 activity
indication characters; any other \fIactivity_spec\fR such as \*(L"acz~\*(R" selects
all activity indication characters in the string, de-selecting all
others.  \s-1BP\s0 will print each selected activity indication character to
\&\fBstdout\fR every time a processing event of the associated type occurs:
.Sp
\&\fBa\fR	new bundle is queued for forwarding
.Sp
\&\fBb\fR	bundle is queued for transmission
.Sp
\&\fBc\fR	bundle is popped from its transmission queue
.Sp
\&\fBm\fR	custody acceptance signal is received
.Sp
\&\fBw\fR	custody of bundle is accepted
.Sp
\&\fBx\fR	custody of bundle is refused
.Sp
\&\fBy\fR	bundle is accepted upon arrival
.Sp
\&\fBz\fR	bundle is queued for delivery to an application
.Sp
\&\fB~\fR	bundle is abandoned (discarded) on attempt to forward it
.Sp
\&\fB!\fR	bundle is destroyed due to \s-1TTL\s0 expiration
.Sp
\&\fB&\fR	custody refusal signal is received
.Sp
\&\fB#\fR	bundle is queued for re-forwarding due to \s-1CL\s0 protocol failure
.Sp
\&\fBj\fR	bundle is placed in \*(L"limbo\*(R" for possible future re-forwarding
.Sp
\&\fBk\fR	bundle is removed from \*(L"limbo\*(R" and queued for re-forwarding
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.
.SH "SCHEME COMMANDS"
.IX Header "SCHEME COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR '\fIforwarder_command\fR' '\fIadmin_app_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "a scheme scheme_name 'forwarder_command' 'admin_app_command'"
The \fBadd scheme\fR command.  This command declares an endpoint naming
\&\*(L"scheme\*(R" for use in endpoint IDs, which are structured as URIs:
\&\fIscheme_name\fR:\fIscheme\-specific_part\fR.  \fIforwarder_command\fR will be
executed when the scheme is started on this node, to initiate operation
of a forwarding daemon for this scheme.  \fIadmin_app_command\fR will also
be executed when the scheme is started on this node, to initiate
operation of a daemon that opens a custodian endpoint identified within
this scheme so that it can receive and process custody signals and bundle
status reports.
.IP "\fBc scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR '\fIforwarder_command\fR' '\fIadmin_app_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "c scheme scheme_name 'forwarder_command' 'admin_app_command'"
The \fBchange scheme\fR command.  This command sets the indicated scheme's 
\&\fIforwarder_command\fR and \fIadmin_app_command\fR to the strings provided
as arguments.
.IP "\fBd scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d scheme scheme_name"
The \fBdelete scheme\fR command.  This command deletes the scheme identified
by \fIscheme_name\fR.  The command will fail if any bundles identified in
this scheme are pending forwarding, transmission, or delivery.
.IP "\fBi scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i scheme scheme_name"
This command will print information (number and commands) about
the endpoint naming scheme identified by \fIscheme_name\fR.

.IP "\fBs scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "s scheme scheme_name"
The \fBstart scheme\fR command.  This command starts the forwarder and
administrative endpoint tasks for the indicated scheme task on the local node.
.IP "\fBx scheme\fR \fIscheme_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "x scheme scheme_name"
The \fBstop scheme\fR command.  This command stops the forwarder and
administrative endpoint tasks for the indicated scheme task on the local node.
.SH "ENDPOINT COMMANDS"
.IX Header "ENDPOINT COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa endpoint\fR \fIendpoint_ID\fR { q | x } ['\fIrecv_script\fR']" 4
.IX Item "a endpoint endpoint_ID { q | x } ['recv_script']"
The \fBadd endpoint\fR command.  This command establishes a \s-1DTN\s0 endpoint named
\&\fIendpoint_ID\fR on the local node.  The remaining parameters indicate
what is to be done when bundles destined for this endpoint arrive at a time
when no application has got the endpoint open for bundle reception.  If 'x',
then such bundles are to be discarded silently and immediately.  If 'q',
then such bundles are to be enqueued for later delivery and, if \fIrecv_script\fR
is provided, \fIrecv_script\fR is to be executed.
.IP "\fBc endpoint\fR \fIendpoint_ID\fR { q | x } ['\fIrecv_script\fR']" 4
.IX Item "c endpoint endpoint_ID { q | x } ['recv_script']"
The \fBchange endpoint\fR command.  This command changes the action that is
to be taken when bundles destined for this endpoint arrive at a time
when no application has got the endpoint open for bundle reception, as
described above.
.IP "\fBd endpoint\fR \fIendpoint_ID\fR" 4
.IX Item "d endpoint endpoint_ID"
The \fBdelete endpoint\fR command.  This command deletes the endpoint identified
by \fIendpoint_ID\fR.  The command will fail if any bundles are currently
pending delivery to this endpoint.
.IP "\fBi endpoint\fR \fIendpoint_ID\fR" 4
.IX Item "i endpoint endpoint_ID"
This command will print information (disposition and script) about
the endpoint identified by \fIendpoint_ID\fR.
.IP "\fBl endpoint\fR" 4
.IX Item "l endpoint"
This command lists all local endpoints, regardless of scheme name.
.SH "PROTOCOL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "PROTOCOL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa protocol\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR \fIpayload_bytes_per_frame\fR \fIoverhead_bytes_per_frame\fR [\fInominal_data_rate\fR]" 4
.IX Item "a protocol protocol_name payload_bytes_per_frame overhead_bytes_per_frame [nominal_data_rate]"
The \fBadd protocol\fR command.  This command establishes access to the named
convergence layer protocol at the local node.  The \fIpayload_bytes_per_frame\fR
and \fIoverhead_bytes_per_frame\fR arguments are used in calculating the
estimated transmission capacity consumption of each bundle, to aid in
route computation and congestion forecasting.
.Sp
The optional \fInominal_data_rate\fR argument overrides the hard-coded default
continuous data rate for the indicated protocol, for purposes of rate
control.  For all \*(L"promiscuous\*(R" prototocols \- that is, protocols whose
outducts are not specifically dedicated to transmission to a single
identified convergence-layer protocol endpoing \- the protocol's applicable
nominal continuous data rate is the data rate that is always used for
rate control over links served by that protocol; data rates are not
extracted from contact graph information.  This is because only the
induct and outduct throttles for non-promiscuous protocols (\s-1LTP, TCP\s0)
can be dynamically adjusted in response to changes in data rate between
the local node and its neighbors, as enacted per the contact plan.  Even
for an outduct of a non-promiscuous protocol the nominal data rate may
be the authority for rate control, in the event that the contact plan
lacks identified contacts with the node to which the outduct is mapped.
.IP "\fBd protocol\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d protocol protocol_name"
The \fBdelete protocol\fR command.  This command deletes the convergence layer
protocol identified by \fIprotocol_name\fR.  The command will fail if any ducts
are still locally declared for this protocol.
.IP "\fBi protocol\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i protocol protocol_name"
This command will print information about the convergence layer protocol
identified by \fIprotocol_name\fR.
.IP "\fBl protocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "l protocol"
This command lists all convergence layer protocols that can currently
be utilized at the local node.
.IP "\fBs protocol\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "s protocol protocol_name"
The \fBstart protocol\fR command.  This command starts all induct and outduct
tasks for inducts and outducts that have been defined for the indicated
\&\s-1CL\s0 protocol on the local node.
.IP "\fBx protocol\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "x protocol protocol_name"
The \fBstop protocol\fR command.  This command stops all induct and outduct
tasks for inducts and outducts that have been defined for the indicated
\&\s-1CL\s0 protocol on the local node.
.SH "INDUCT COMMANDS"
.IX Header "INDUCT COMMANDS"

.IX Item "a induct protocol_name duct_name 'CLI_command'"
The \fBadd induct\fR command.  This command establishes a \*(L"duct\*(R" for reception
of bundles via the indicated \s-1CL\s0 protocol.  The duct's data acquisition
structure is used and populated by the \*(L"induct\*(R" task whose operation is
initiated by \fICLI_command\fR at the time the duct is started.
.IP "\fBc induct\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR \fIduct_name\fR '\fICLI_command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "c induct protocol_name duct_name 'CLI_command'"
The \fBchange induct\fR command.  This command changes the command that is
used to initiate operation of the induct task for the indicated duct.
.IP "\fBd induct\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR \fIduct_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d induct protocol_name duct_name"
The \fBdelete induct\fR command.  This command deletes the induct identified
by \fIprotocol_name\fR and \fIduct_name\fR.  The command will fail if any bundles
are currently pending acquisition via this induct.
.IP "\fBi induct\fR \fIprotocol_name\fR \fIduct_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i induct protocol_name duct_name"

The \fBadd outduct\fR command.  This command establishes a \*(L"duct\*(R" for transmission
of bundles via the indicated \s-1CL\s0 protocol.  The duct's data transmission
structure is serviced by the \*(L"outduct\*(R" task whose operation is
initiated by \fICLO_command\fR at the time the duct is started.  A value of
zero for \fImax_payload_length\fR indicates that bundles of any size can be
