.SH "NAME"
bssrc \- IPN scheme configuration commands file adapted for Bundle Streaming Service
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1IPN\s0 scheme configuration commands are passed to \fBbssadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBbssadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.
.PP
\&\s-1IPN\s0 scheme configuration commands (a) manage a table of destination endpoints
that are known to be associated with Bundle Streaming Service (\s-1BSS\s0)
applications, (b) establish BSS-adapted egress plans for direct transmission
to neighboring nodes that are members of endpoints identified in the \*(L"ipn\*(R"
\&\s-1URI\s0 scheme, and (c) establish static default routing rules for forwarding
bundles to specified destination nodes.
.PP
A \s-1BSS\s0 endpoint table \fBentry\fR identifies an \s-1IPN\s0 endpoint \s-1ID\s0 \*(-- in which
the node number and/or service number may be the wild-card character '*' \*(--
that is known to be associated with a \s-1BSS\s0 application.  These table entries
enable \fBbssfw\fR to distinguish \s-1BSS\s0 bundles from non-BSS traffic and apply
BSS-specific egress planning logic to the former while handling the latter
in exactly the same way as \fBipnfw\fR.
.PP
The egress \fBplan\fR established for a given neighboring node associates three
default egress \fBduct expressions\fR with that node: one for \s-1BSS\s0 traffic that
must be forwarded as real-time streaming data (using a convergence-layer
protocol that does not perform retransmission), one for \s-1BSS\s0 traffic that
must be forwarded as playback data (using a reliable convergence-layer
protocol), and one for non-BSS traffic.  These default duct expressions may
be overridden by more narrowly scoped \fBplanrule\fRs in specific circumstances:
different egress duct expressions may apply when the source endpoint for
the subject bundle identifies a specific node, a specific service, or both.
.PP
Each duct expression is a string of the form
"\fIprotocol_name\fR/\fIoutduct_name\fR[,\fIdestination_induct_name\fR]",
signifying that the bundle is to be queued for transmission via the
indicated convergence layer protocol outduct.  \fIdestination_induct_name\fR
must be provided when the indicated outduct is \*(L"promiscuous\*(R", i.e., not
configured for transmission only to a single neighboring node; this is
protocol-specific.
.PP
The circumstances that characterize a specific rule within a general plan
are expressed in a \fBqualifier\fR, a string of the form
"\fIsource_service_number\fR \fIsource_node_number\fR" where either
\&\fIsource_service_number\fR or \fIsource_node_number\fR may be an asterisk
character (*) signifying \*(L"all\*(R".
.PP
Note that egress plans \fBmust\fR be established for all neighboring nodes,
regardless of whether or not contact graph routing is used for computing
dynamic routes to distant nodes.  This is by definition: if there isn't
an egress plan to a node, it can't be considered a neighbor.
.PP
Static default routes are expressed as \fBgroups\fR in the ipn-scheme routing
database.  A group is a range of node numbers identifying a set of nodes
for which defined default routing behavior is established.  Whenever a
bundle is to be forwarded to a node whose number is in the group's node
number range \fBand\fR it has not been possible to compute a dynamic route
to that node from the contact schedules that have been provided to the
local node \fBand\fR that node is not a neighbor to which the bundle can
be directly transmitted, \s-1BP\s0 will forward the bundle to the \fBgateway\fR node
associated with this group.  The gateway node for any group is identified
by an endpoint \s-1ID,\s0 which might or might not be an ipn-scheme \s-1EID\s0; regardless,
directing a bundle to the gateway for a group causes the bundle to be
re-forwarded to that intermediate destination endpoint.  Multiple groups
may encompass the same node number, in which case the gateway associated
with the most restrictive group (the one with the smallest range) is
always selected.
.PP
The formats and effects of the \s-1BSS\s0 forwarding configuration commands are
described below.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by bssadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.

The \fBadd entry\fR command.  This asserts that all bundles whose destination
endpoint \s-1ID\s0 matches \fIservice_nbr\fR and \fInode_nbr\fR (either or both of which
may be the wild-card character '*') are to be processed as \s-1BSS\s0 traffic.
.IP "\fBd entry\fR \fIservice_nbr\fR \fInode_nbr\fR" 4
.IX Item "d entry service_nbr node_nbr"
The \fBdelete entry\fR command.  This command rescinds a prior \s-1BSS\s0 assertion
characterized by the exact same \fIservice_nbr\fR and \fInode_nbr\fR.

the \s-1BP\s0 agent must wait for custody acceptance after transmitting a bundle on
either \s-1BSS\s0 duct before automatically re-forwarding the bundle.  A general
plan must be in place for a node before any more specific rules are declared.

.IX Item "a plan 18 tcp/saturn.nasa.gov:5011 udp/*,saturn.nasa.gov:5012 tcp/saturn.nasa.gov:5011 3"
Declares the egress plan to use for transmission from the local node to
neighboring node 18.  Any bundle for which the computed \*(L"next hop\*(R" node
is node 18 will be queued for transmission to Internet host saturn.nasa.gov,
using udp if the bundle is real-time \s-1BSS\s0 traffic and tcp otherwise; for \s-1BSS\s0
traffic, custodial retransmission will be initiated after 3 seconds if no
custody acknowledgment is received.

.IX Item "a planrule 18 * 9 tcp/saturn.nasa.gov:5011 udp/*,saturn.nasa.gov:5012 tcp/neptune.nasa.gov:5011"
Declares an egress plan override that applies to transmission to node 18
of any bundle whose source is node 9, regardless of the service that was
the source of the bundle.  Each such bundle must be queued for transmission
to Internet host neptune.nasa.gov, rather than default host saturn.nasa.gov,
if it is non-real-time \s-1BSS\s0 traffic.
.IP "a group 1 999 dtn://stargate" 4

such bundles are to be forwarded to \*(L"dtn://stargate\*(R".
